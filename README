 MAMECLOT: MAke ME a CLuster Or Two

 Construct initial conditions for a system of 1 (or 2) cluster(s)

 A 2 cluster system with orbit in the x-y plane is made if the mass ratio q>0 
 Five equilibrium models are available, positions are sampled up to 20r_h 
 The velocities can be isotropic or radially anisotropic (a la Osipkov-Merritt)
 Optional angular momentum by aligning the angular momentum vectors along z
 System is scaled to N-body units with G = M = -4E = 1 (Heggie & Mathieu 1986)
 In the case of a two-body system E = E_orb + E_1 + E_2 
 The 2-body orbit is computed from input q, Ehat and Lhat (and eta if 0<q<1):
        Ehat = E_orb/0.5<sigma^2> 
        Lhat = L_orb/<r_vir*sigma>
        eta => defines the relative radii: r2/r1 = q^eta, for example:
               eta=[-0.33/0/0.33/0.5] for equal [t_rh/r_h/rho_h/Sigma_h]

 Mass, pos[3], vel[3] are written to standard output
 System diagnostics are written to the standard error
