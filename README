This code generates initital conditions for a system of 1 or 2 cluster

Compile:

make

This create the executable mameclot

For CUDA enabled GPU support compile as

make gpu

This creates the executable mameclot.gpu for fast energy scaling on a GPU 
Perhaps necessary to change the paths of cuda and cuda libs in the Makefile

For help run:

./mameclot -h
